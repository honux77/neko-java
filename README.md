## Cute Neko Project written in Java

![neko](finish.gif)

This is the Java GUI exercise program for study.

There may be original Neko project, but I can't find it.

I just download images of Neko and implement this program.

## Run

`net.honux.neko.Box` is the main class of this app.
simply Run `Box.main` method using IDE like IntelliJ IDEA
